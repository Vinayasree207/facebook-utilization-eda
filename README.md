## **Actionable Insights**

 - As we know from Introduction that Facebook is more than just a social networking platform; it's also a business:
   - as female users are more active, facebook can use this as a strategy for targeting female customers for marketing the female oriented products or informations, which will increase the retention of Female users.
   
  - Even though male users are highest in number, we can observe male users are not so active, therefore facebook can look to attract male users also by giving more friend suggestions and product suggestions, which makes them more active users.

 - As Mobile App is the preferred option among all the users, Facebook shall concentrate developing the updates and more user freindly features on the mobile app.

Missing Points in Data which would have helped in better analysis:

- Total time spent on facebook per day/hour of users would have helped in analysing the total screen Time spent on app.
- Data on other activities like unfriending/blocking to understand the behavourial pattern of users.
- Frequency of the posts made by the user on basis different age,gender and tenure.
